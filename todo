(not important now since we don't need grid lines now)1. use two buffers:
    one for grid (static)
    one for bricks (dynamic)

2. use different shader:
    dark color for grids
    differeny color for different bricks

3. add shape:
    difficulties 1: compute collision of a whole shape
    difficulties 2: rotation of shape
